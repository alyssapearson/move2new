MOVE/SYNC PART 2

---

The company would like to incorporate more photos of women onto their one-page website (use at least 2 new images in the folder). In addition, they would like to add the following text (can appear in any order):

Progress
Stay on track with online and mobile tools that show your progress as charts and graphs on the MOVE/SYNC dashboard.

Achieve
Reach your goals by seeing progress notifications and celebrate milestones with achievement badges.

Inspire
Encourage friends and family to join your path to fitness with the leaderboard, group challenges, and cheers or taunts.

Freedom
Everyone's approach to fitness is different and so is ours. "One size fits all" doesn't always fit you.

MOVE/SYNC is accessible on 120+ phones, including Android, iOS and Windows - more than any other tracker.

Your fitness journey is your own. You should be able to share what you want, when you want. That's why we don't sell your private data - and why we never budge on privacy.

Additional instructions:
- You may incorporate more images as you see fit, such as icons. 
- Use the new css properties 'float' and/or 'display'.
- Use this opportunity to improve your design: Do your font choices and color scheme fit the product and the intended audience? Are your messages and call-to-action clear? Is your website easy to use and engaging?
- Place all your files (html, css, images) in a folder called "move2‚Äù and place it in your folder on the class drive.
